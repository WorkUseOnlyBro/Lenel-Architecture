GPT comments on load balancing
4) Practical “load balancing” patterns that do work with OnGuard ecosystems
Even if Lenel services themselves aren’t actively load balanced, people commonly build:
Two+ web/app servers behind an LB (ARR/F5/NetScaler/NGINX) for the UI/API tier
Database HA separately (SQL clustering/AG) (this is usually where OnGuard doc goes next, but it’s gated)
Service redundancy where supported (comm server, recorder failover), not LB

Claude on load balancing 

Direct RabbitMQ Clustering
RabbitMQ has built-in clustering and load balancing capabilities. You could:

Set up a RabbitMQ cluster with multiple nodes
Use HAProxy or similar load balancer in front of the cluster
Configure OpenAccess clients to connect through the load balancer endpoint
RabbitMQ's native mirrored queues can provide redundancy

Middleware/Proxy Approach
Your middleman server idea has merit:

Build a lightweight service that acts as a message broker proxy
It receives requests and routes them to available OnGuard instances based on load
Could use round-robin, least-connections, or health-check based routing
This gives you more control over routing logic specific to Lenel workflows

Application-Level Load Balancing

Deploy multiple OpenAccess server instances
Use DNS round-robin or a Layer 4 load balancer (F5, Nginx, HAProxy)
Each instance connects to its own or shared database
May need to handle session affinity for certain operations

Considerations Specific to Lenel

Licensing: Check if your Lenel licenses support multiple concurrent OpenAccess instances
Database contention: Multiple OpenAccess instances hitting the same SQL database may create bottlenecks
Event synchronization: Ensure real-time events (door opens, alarms) are properly distributed
State management: Some operations may require sticky sessions

What's your current bottleneck - is it the message queuing, the OpenAccess API processing, or database queries? That would help determine the best approach.
